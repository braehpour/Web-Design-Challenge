# Web-Design-Challenge
### In this project we were to create a web page which displays the vizualizations from one of our previous projects. I used the weather data from our api challenge. I first setup a the initial structure of the landing page (index.html), then worked out from there to create the various visualization pages, along with the comparison page. Once that was completed, I then added the original .ipynb file, along with the needed api keys to properly work the file. I added a line of code to export the pandas dataframe to html, which then allowed me to create the data page.

### Using bootstrap, I then made sure the table was responsive to ensure it worked on all screeensizes. After I completed that, added my media query to again ensure that this file worked on all screen sizes, and changed formatting to reflect the screen size as well. I then finished up this project with some final formatting, and then I uploaded this file to GitHub pages, as well as filled in my ReadMe file.
